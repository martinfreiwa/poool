## 4. Playwright Strictness Audit
| Violation Type | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `wait_for_timeout` | `test_admin_financials.py` | Hardcoded `2000ms` waits. Replace with `expect()`. |
| `networkidle` | All test files | Anti-pattern. Use `expect_response` or `wait_for_url`. |
| Python `assert` | `test_admin_financials.py` | Use Playwright `expect().to_have_text()` instead. |
| Brittle selectors | All test files | `page.locator("#id")` → use `page.get_by_role()` / `page.get_by_text()`. |
| Missing `page.route()` | All test files | No network interception for validation. |
| Missing mobile | Most tests | Only desktop 1280x800. Need 375x812 parameterization. |

## 6. Automatic Quality Checks (Built Into Every Test)
Every test fixture (`quality_page`, `authenticated_user_page`, `admin_page`) automatically includes the `PageQualityTracker` which performs these checks **without any extra code in individual tests**:

### 6.1 What Gets Monitored Automatically
| Check | How It Works | What Breaks the Test |
|---|---|---|
| **Console Errors** | `page.on("console")` captures ALL `console.error` messages | `.assert_no_critical_errors()` fails if uncaught JS exceptions exist |
| **Console Warnings** | `page.on("console")` captures `console.warn` messages | Logged in report; doesn't fail test unless explicitly checked |
| **Uncaught Exceptions** | `page.on("pageerror")` catches unhandled JS errors/throws | Always recorded as critical — auto-fails |
| **Network Failures (4xx/5xx)** | `page.on("response")` tracks every HTTP response | `.assert_no_network_failures()` fails on any 4xx/5xx response |
| **Resource Load Failures** | `page.on("requestfailed")` catches DNS/CORS/network errors | Logged in report; available for assertions |
| **Page Load Verification** | `tracker.navigate_and_check(url)` records load time | Fails if HTTP 500+ or unexpected redirect to login |
| **Blank Page Detection** | `.assert_page_loaded()` checks `body` has ≥ 5 chars of text | Fails if page renders blank/empty |
| **Page Load Time** | `time.time()` delta measured per navigation | Logged in JSON report; can set performance thresholds |
| **Screenshot on Failure** | `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook detects failures | Auto-saved to `tests/e2e/screenshots/FAIL_*.png` |
| **Quality Report** | Full JSON report generated after each test | Saved to `tests/e2e/reports/*.json` |

### 6.2 How Tests Use This
```python
# EXAMPLE: Basic page load health test
def test_marketplace_loads(quality_page):
    page, tracker = quality_page
    tracker.navigate_and_check(f"{BASE_URL}/marketplace")

    # These assertions run AUTOMATICALLY:
    tracker.assert_page_loaded()         # Not blank
    tracker.assert_no_critical_errors()  # No JS exceptions
    tracker.assert_no_network_failures() # No 4xx/5xx

    # Page-specific assertions
    expect(page.get_by_role("heading", name="Marketplace")).to_be_visible()
```

### 6.3 Noise Filtering
The tracker intelligently filters noise so tests don't false-flag on:
- `favicon.ico` 404s
- Ad blocker `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` errors
- Chrome `ResizeObserver loop` warnings
- Third-party analytics/Sentry/Google Tag failures
- Third-party cookie warnings
